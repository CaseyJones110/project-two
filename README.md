# Project 1: Tic Tac Toe

## Technologies

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery for this app

## Approach

Once the page loads, the game is ready to go. Each player can submit their name
before they begin. Player is initially set to 1. When they click, an X will appear 
in their chosen spot. Player will then be incremented to 2 and the second player
can set an O in their choice of spot. Player will continue to increment to track the
number of turns in a game. Every odd turn will result in an X while every even 
turn will result in an O. When the game is over, the players can start a New Game
with the button below the gamge grid and all spots will be reset. 

## Unsolved Problems

I wanted to create an animation which would draw a line across the three winning 
squares. I wasn't able to figure out how to complete that step, but I think with more
time, I could get there.
